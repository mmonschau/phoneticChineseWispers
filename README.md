# Phonetic Encoding Chinese Whispers

A small python web-app built as a game for first semesters at our local hacking university group.
Built for evaluating the effectiveness of different phonetic encoding techniques and string distance metrics.

## Usage
### Game leader
Start the 'phoneticEncoding.py' and go to the "/admin"-page. Here you can generate new Game tokens or close a running
game. Results can be accessed from the main-page.

### Players
Just go to the main-page of the webserver and enter the game token. The chinese whispers work the usual way, but every
intermediate step is also written down.
